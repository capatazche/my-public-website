## Theming

- Managed in `ThemeContext.tsx` and persisted to `localStorage`.
- Applied early via `index.html` to avoid flashes.
- Colors defined in `index.css` under custom `@theme` block and `[data-theme="light"]` override.

## Routing

- Defined in `src/main.tsx`
    - `/` â†’ HomePage
    - `/resume` â†’ ResumePage

## Deployment (AWS Amplify + Terraform)

The `infra/` directory automates setup of AWS Amplify hosting, IAM roles, and domain linkage.

**1. Configure Variables**

```bash
cd infra
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
```

Edit `terraform.tfvars`:

```hcl
domain_name    = "my-domain.com"
repository_url = "https://github.com/your-username/your-fork"
aws_region     = "us-east-1"
```

**2. Initialize & Apply**

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

**3. Complete Amplify Setup**
- In the AWS console, go to the newly created Amplify app and connect your GitHub repository.
- Add the provided CNAME record to your domain registrar for SSL and DNS verification.
- After verification, your site will be live at your custom domain. ðŸŽ‰

## Visitor Tracking (Amplify Gen 2)

This project uses Amplify Gen 2 Data to track visitors in two DynamoDB models:

- Stats: Stores counters for totalVisitors and uniqueVisitors.
- Visitor: Stores each visitorId, lastSeen, and expirationTime (30 days out).

How it works:
- On app start, the client generates/persists a visitorId in localStorage and calls a custom mutation trackVisit.
- The mutation is implemented as a Lambda function that atomically:
  - Upserts the Visitor record, updating lastSeen and pushing expirationTime 30 days forward.
  - Increments Stats.totalVisitors (+1 always) and Stats.uniqueVisitors (+1 only if the visitor is new).

Key files:
- amplify/data/resource.ts: Models and the custom trackVisit mutation
- amplify/functions/track-visit: Lambda definition and handler
- src/lib/visitorTracking.ts: Client helper that invokes the mutation
- src/main.tsx: Boots visitor tracking after Amplify.configure

Deployment notes:
- After pulling/pushing the backend (amplify push), the function and schema will be deployed.
- Default authorization mode is identityPool, and both guest and authenticated users are allowed to call trackVisit.
